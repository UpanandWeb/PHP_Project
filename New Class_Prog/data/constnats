Define():
========
by using this method we can define constants
this method contains two parameters
1.name of the constant
2.value of the constant

synatax:
define("key","value");

by using the name of the constant we can access the constant values

echo state;
echo city;

Note: Constants are case sensitive

echo STATE;//error
